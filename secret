This is a secret file, it is useless unless you really want to read all of that
Anyways, if you want to continue read some yapping you can, or you could just continue the exercices i've proposed, it is to you to decide
btw i don't know what i type in english, since y'all talk french fluently (i hope, or at least you understand it)

But if you continue reading, i guess it is my duty to reward you a little bit.
So i'll be blessing you with my great knowledge and teach you something other don't know.

there is something that i havn't talked about "cherry-pick"

this is a great source of conflict, so try it with precaution, but cherry-pick is a form of merge where you can select exaclty the commit you want and add it to your branch.
The branches will not merged between them, but changes will be applied (that's why it is mandatory to take GREAT precaution because it can break really easily)

and btw i really recommand using a vizualiser like lazygit or gitg to understand correctly your R.E.P.O.

was this usefull ? i don't think so but now you havn't wasted 5 min of reading :)
